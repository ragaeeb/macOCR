# macOCR

A minimal Swift command-line tool that uses Apple's [Vision framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision) to perform high-accuracy OCR on images and export structured JSON output. Ideal for integration with Node.js or other systems for downstream processing.

## Features

- Leverages `VNRecognizeTextRequestRevision3` for improved accuracy and RTL support.
- Outputs structured JSON including:
  - Top OCR candidates
  - Text confidence
  - Bounding box geometry
- Automatically detects supported OCR languages
- Supports individual images or whole directories
- Outputs `.json` files named after the original image

## Requirements

- macOS 13+
- Swift 5.7+
- Xcode 14+

## Usage

```sh
macOCR <language> <image_path|directory_path> [output_dir]
```

### Examples

#### OCR a single image:

```sh
macOCR ar ./page1.jpg ./output/
```

This will produce `./output/page1.json`.

#### OCR all images in a directory:

```sh
macOCR en ./scanned_pages ./output/
```

This will process each image in the folder and output JSON files with matching names into `./output/`.

#### Show help (and list of supported languages):

```sh
macOCR
```

## Output Format

Each `.json` file will contain an array of OCR blocks, for example:

```json
[
  {
    "observationBoundingBox": { "x": ..., "y": ..., "width": ..., "height": ... },
    "candidates": [
      {
        "text": "Sample text",
        "confidence": 0.85,
        "boundingBox": { "x": ..., "y": ..., "width": ..., "height": ... }
      }
    ]
  },
  ...
]
```

## Notes

- Right-to-left languages like Arabic are supported.
- You can pass multiple comma-separated language codes (e.g., `en,ar`).
- Custom OCR vocabulary can be added via the Vision API (not yet exposed via CLI).

## Build

### Release build (Recommended for production):

From Xcode:

1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Go to `Product > Archive`
3. Export the built binary via `Organizer > Distribute Content`

From terminal:

```sh
swift build -c release
```

Resulting binary will be in:

```
.build/release/macOCR
```

## üîí Releasing & Notarizing the macOCR CLI Tool

This section documents the **complete process** for code-signing, notarizing, and preparing your `macOCR` Swift command-line tool for distribution. It includes detailed steps as well as common troubleshooting tips.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Build the Production Binary in Xcode

1. Open your Xcode project.
2. Go to `Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme`.
3. Under **Run** or **Archive**, ensure the build configuration is set to **Release**.
4. Use:
   ```bash
   CMD + B
   ```
   to build, or go to:
   ```
   Product > Archive
   ```

---

### üîè 2. Code Sign the Binary

Make sure your Developer ID certificate is installed and visible:

```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

Then sign your binary:

```bash
codesign --timestamp --options runtime --sign "Developer ID Application: YOUR NAME (TEAMID)" ./OCR
```

Or use the certificate hash:

```bash
codesign --timestamp --options runtime --sign E0F5D47B058F455216F3E2BA3D6EA58E07453C32 ./OCR
```

**Verify the signature**:

```bash
codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=2 ./OCR
```

---

### üì¶ 3. Create a Zip Archive

```bash
ditto -c -k --keepParent ./OCR OCR.zip
```

---

### üßæ 4. Submit for Notarization

```bash
xcrun notarytool submit OCR.zip \
  --apple-id "you@example.com" \
  --team-id "YOURTEAMID" \
  --password "your-app-specific-password" \
  --wait
```

Expected output should end in:

```
status: Accepted
```

---

### üß™ 5. Confirm Notarization

To double-check:

```bash
xcrun notarytool log <submission-id>
```

---

### üö´ What **Not** to Do for CLI Binaries

- ‚ùå Do not run `stapler staple` on the binary. It only works for `.app`, `.pkg`, or `.dmg`.
- ‚ùå Do not rely on `spctl` for binaries. It will show:
  ```
  the code is valid but does not seem to be an app
  ```

This is expected for CLI tools and doesn't indicate an error.

---

### üß∞ Troubleshooting

#### I see two Developer IDs in `security find-identity`

This is common if you've imported the same certificate twice. It's harmless, but you can attempt to delete one via:

```bash
security delete-identity -c "Developer ID Application: Your Name" login
```

> üî∏ May fail due to permissions; you can ignore unless it's causing conflict.

#### `stapler` fails with error 73

Expected. CLI binaries don't get stapled.

#### `spctl` rejects my binary

Expected. `spctl` is for apps, not CLI tools.

---

### üì¶ Final Notes

- You can now distribute the `OCR.zip` safely.
- On first run, macOS will verify its notarization **online**.
